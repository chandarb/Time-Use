  <labl>Person weight, 2006 methodology</labl>
  <txt><![CDATA[WT06 provides ATUS respondent weights based on the weighting methodology introduced in 2006. WT06 is available for all years and is the preferred weighting variable to use for most analyses.  It is the only weighting variable that is suitable for use in analyses that combine time use data from 2006 and later with data for earlier years.  The methodology used to construct WT06 ensures that the sums of the respondent weights add up to the appropriate number of weekday person-days and weekend person-days over the quarter, both for the population as a whole and for selected subpopulations. 

All ATUS weights are probability weights. Users should take care to specify them properly in their statistical packages.

Because the ATUS sample is not a simple random sample, standard errors calculated using the default options in most statistical packages will not be correct.  Calculation of correct standard errors requires the use of replicate weights.  RWT06 may be used in conjunction with WT06 for this purpose; for further details, see the description of RWT06.]]></txt>

  <labl>Labor force status</labl>
  <txt><![CDATA[EMPSTAT indicates whether persons were part of the labor force--working or seeking work--and, if so, whether they were currently unemployed. 

Employment status was determined on the basis of answers to a series of questions relating to their activities during the preceding week. Those who reported doing any work at all for pay or profit, or working at least fifteen hours without pay in a family business or farm, were classified as "at work." Those who did not work during the previous week but who acknowledged having a job or business from which they were temporarily absent (e.g., due to illness, vacation, bad weather, or labor dispute) were also classified as employed, under the heading "employed - absent." 

Unemployed persons make up the third element of the labor force. Individuals were coded as unemployed if they did no work for pay or profit, did not have a job from which they were briefly absent, and answered yes to a question about whether they had been looking for work in the past four weeks. People who were temporarily laid off from a job were also classified as unemployed. 

Persons who were neither employed nor unemployed fall into the residual category, "not in labor force." Such individuals might be retired, disabled due to an illness lasting at least 6 months, occupied with other activities such as attending school or keeping house, or convinced that they are unlikely to find employment (discouraged workers).

EMPSTAT was collected at the time of the ATUS interview.  Employment status was also collected at the time of the final CPS interview, 2-5 months before the ATUS interview.  See EMPSTAT_CPS8.  EMPSTAT_CPS8 distinguishes between not being in the labor force due to retirement, disability, or other reasons, but EMPSTAT does not.]]></txt>

  <txt><![CDATA[OCC reports the four-digit Census occupational code for the respondent's main job.  

Researchers who would like broader occupational categories may wish to use OCC2, which collapses occupation information into fewer, broader categories.

OCC was collected at the time of the ATUS interview.  Occupation information for the respondent's main job was also collected at the time of the final CPS interview, 2-5 months before the ATUS interview.  See OCC_CPS8 for four-digit Census occupational categories (and OCC2_CPS8for general categories).

If a respondent has another (second) job, OCC_OJ_CPS8 reports the occupation information for that job using the same four-digit Census categories as OCC_CPS8.  OCC2_OJ_CPS8 reports occupation information for the second job using the broader categories.  Information on the respondent's second job was not collected at the time of the ATUS interview.]]></txt>
